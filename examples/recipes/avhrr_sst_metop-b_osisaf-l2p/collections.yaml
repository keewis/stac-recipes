  description: >-
    The satellite input data has successively come from Metop-A, Metop-B and Metop-C level 1 data processed at EUMETSAT. SST is retrieved from AVHRR infrared channels (3.7, 10.8 and 12.0 Âµm) using a multispectral algorithm and a cloud mask.
    Atmospheric profiles of water vapor and temperature from a numerical weather prediction model, Sea Surface Temperature from an analysis, together with a radiative transfer model, are used to correct the multispectral algorithm for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions.
    The quality of the products is monitored regularly by daily comparison of the satellite estimates against buoy measurements.
    The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version 2. Users are advised to use data only with quality levels 3,4 and 5.
