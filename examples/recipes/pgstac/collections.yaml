  description: >-
    For the Global Ocean- Sea Surface Temperature L3 Observations. This product
    provides daily foundation sea surface temperature from multiple satellite
    sources. The data are intercalibrated. This product consists in a fusion of
    sea surface temperature observations from multiple satellite sensors, daily,
    over a 0.1Â° resolution global grid. It includes observations by polar
    orbiting (NOAA-18 & NOAAA-19/AVHRR, METOP-A/AVHRR, ENVISAT/AATSR,
    AQUA/AMSRE, TRMM/TMI) and geostationary (MSG/SEVIRI, GOES-11) satellites .
    The observations of each sensor are intercalibrated prior to merging using a
    bias correction based on a multi-sensor median reference correcting the
    large-scale cross-sensor biases.3 more datasets are available that only
    contain "per sensor type" data: Polar InfraRed (PIR), Polar MicroWave (PMW),
    Geostationary InfraRed (GIR)
